Distraction Tool for Red-Team - VBS Script

The basic goal of this tool is to infinitely open the notepad, print the message HA HA HA HA HA HACKED HA HA HA HA HA and play the audio message: Congratulations, you've been hacked and will continuously blink the lights on the keyboard. 

To run this program simply double click it on a windows machine. 
NOTE: The text will not be printed unless the notepad is clicked on, or it will type on anything that windows allows you to type on. For example, the search bar if you click it or the notepad if you click it.
