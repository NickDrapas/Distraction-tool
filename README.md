Distraction Tool for Red-Team - VBS Script

The primary goal of this tool is to open the notepad infinitely, print the message HA HA HA HA HACKED HA HA HA HA, and it will play the audio message: Congratulations, you've been hack and will continuously blink the lights on the keyboard. 

To run this program simply double click it on a windows machine. 
NOTE: The text will not be printed unless the notepad is clicked on, or it will type on anything that windows allows you to type on. For example, the search bar if you click it or the notepad if you click it. 

To stop this entire process, the user needs to restart the computer.
